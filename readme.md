## Our project

This is our To-do app. We were provided with a skeleton of a working app, our task was to make this a fully functional app. 
For this project we used the following:

1. Unit testing
2. TDD 
3. DOM manipulation
4. Tape
5. Tape-spec


## How to run this repo

To run this repository, clone it to a local folder.

Go into the project folder: type `cd /BBFS-todo` into the terminal.

Type `npm i` in the terminal to install the package manager (this includes the packages which run the test environment).

Type `npm test` to run tests on all the functions contained in the `todoFunctions` object. These are the functions that make the to-do list work.

To see the to-do list in action, either open the index.html file locally or see it on GitHub pages: https://fac-sixteen.github.io/BBFS-todo/.

## User journey:

1. enter tasks I need to do into a web page so that I don't forget them
2. view the tasks I have added in a list so that I can plan my day
3. mark tasks as complete so that I can focus on the tasks I have left
4. the to-dos to be large enough so that I don't hit the wrong one with my thumb


## Our approach

1. Read project task thoroughly to ensure we all are on the same page.
2. Together we decided to all work on one laptop throughout most part of the project.
2. After the code review session we split up into pairs to resolve raised issues.



## What we learnt

Biggest lesson we have learnt take time with writing thorough tests!
